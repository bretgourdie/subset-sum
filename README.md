# subset-sum
Finds the subset of numbers that add together to make a sum.

1. Type your sum into the "Sum" textbox.
2. Type or paste your values (separated by whitespace) in the "Values" textbox.
3. Click "Calculate" to see all subsets that equal the target sum when added together!

# Notes
The total number of computed subsets is 2<sup>Values</sup>; be careful of how many values you put in! It could cause the program to chug.

This program accepts Decimal numbers in addition to Integers.

Separate Values with newlines, spaces, or tabs. Do not use commas. A copy-paste from Excel should always do the right thing.
